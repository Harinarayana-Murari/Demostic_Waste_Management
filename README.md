# Domestic Waste Management Website

## Overview

The **Domestic Waste Management Website** is designed to promote environmentally friendly waste management practices while incentivizing users to engage in recycling activities. This platform integrates multiple features aimed at educating users about waste management, rewarding them for eco-friendly actions, and providing them with an opportunity to redeem recycled plastic products.

The system revolves around **smart dustbins**, which track the amount of waste a user generates. When the dustbin is full, users earn **points or coins** based on the waste they have contributed. These coins can then be used on the **e-commerce page** to purchase products made from recycled plastic, fostering a circular economy and encouraging sustainable consumption.

## Key Features

### 1. E-commerce Platform for Recycled Products
The website includes a **shop page** that offers a variety of eco-friendly products made from recycled materials. Users can redeem these products using the coins theyâ€™ve earned through responsible waste disposal. This encourages users to contribute more to recycling and provides an incentive to participate in environmentally conscious practices.

### 2. Smart Dustbin System with Rewards
Our system is integrated with **smart dustbins**, which notify the user when they are full. Each time a smart dustbin is full, the user is awarded coins based on the amount of waste they have deposited. This real-time tracking system helps to gamify waste management, making it more engaging for users.

### 3. Quiz Page for Environmental Awareness
To complement the practical rewards system, we have designed a **quiz page** where users can test and improve their knowledge about domestic waste management and environmental sustainability. This helps raise awareness about the importance of proper waste disposal and recycling.

## Benefits

- **Encourages Recycling**: By offering a tangible reward system, users are motivated to segregate and recycle waste efficiently.
- **Increases Awareness**: The quiz page educates users on waste management best practices and the environmental impact of improper disposal.
- **Sustainable Consumption**: The e-commerce platform promotes the use of recycled products, reinforcing the importance of sustainability in everyday life.
- **Incentivizes Participation**: Users are rewarded for their eco-friendly behavior, making it easier for them to adopt sustainable habits.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (used to store user data, rewards, and product inventory)
- **Smart Dustbin Integration**: IoT-based sensors to monitor waste levels and trigger reward allocation

## Future Plans

- **Enhanced Gamification**: Introduce leaderboards and more interactive quizzes to further engage users in waste management education.
